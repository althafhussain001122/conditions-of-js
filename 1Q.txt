Conditional statements are programming constructs that allow you to execute different blocks of code based on whether a specified condition is true or false. They enable decision-making in your code, allowing it to react dynamically to various situations.

Syntax
The basic structure of a conditional statement typically includes:

If Statement: Executes a block of code if a specified condition is true.
Else Statement: Executes a block of code if the condition in the if statement is false.
Else If Statement: Checks another condition if the previous if or else if conditions are false.

Syntax:

if (condition) {
    // code to execute if condition is true
} else if (another_condition) {
    // code to execute if another_condition is true
} else {
    // code to execute if all conditions are false
}

EXAMPLE:
let temperature = 30;

if (temperature > 30) {
    console.log("It's a hot day.");
} else if (temperature < 15) {
    console.log("It's a cold day.");
} else {
    console.log("It's a mild day.");
}
